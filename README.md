# EDGE-machine-learning-program

This repository contains Python scripts and a dataset related to a machine learning project, likely focused on predicting edge computing performance or related metrics. 

## Project Overview

The project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. 
The primary dataset, `Edge Final Project Dataset.xlsx`, appears to be the core data source for training and evaluating the model. 
The Python script, `Edge Final Project.py`, implements the machine learning model and likely performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

* **`Edge Final Project Dataset.xlsx`:** This file contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
* It is an Excel file, suggesting it contains structured data suitable for machine learning tasks.
* Further details about the dataset's features, target variable, and data source are needed for a complete understanding.

## Code

* **`Edge Final Project.py`:** This Python script implements the core machine learning logic of the project. It likely includes:
    * Data loading and preprocessing using libraries like Pandas.
    * Feature engineering to transform and prepare the data for the model.
    * Model selection, training, and evaluation using libraries like scikit-learn.
    * Potentially, model tuning and hyperparameter optimization.

* **`Midterm exam-Fibonacci number.py` & `Midterm exam-Mobile usage.py`:** These scripts are unrelated to the main project and are from a midterm exam.
* They implement algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers and analyzing mobile usage data.
